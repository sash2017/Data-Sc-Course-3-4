This file contains the r code for the assignment. The code does the following:

a. Reads data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

b. Merges the training and test data sets into one set

c. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

d. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

e. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

f. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

2. CodeBook.md

This is an md file consisting of the descriptions of the variables used in the code, the inputs, the outputs and details of any processing done with the raw data to get the tidy data as output.
